# DataPopEu_Project
R code for the implementation of the project's statistical analyses (Supervised ML, Sentiment Analysis, Human-in-the-loop algorithm), visualizations as well as data collection (Scraping and API). The "Analysis" file contains a human-in-the-loop algorithm that I developed, which improves its classification accuracy by interacting with the user. The algorithm has hashes so they need removing prior to running. Please contact me if you need me to provide you with the data.
